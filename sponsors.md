Computers that can read and write are already here, and they have the potential to fundamentally change the relationship between humans and machines. Today, Cohere enables access to large language models to access this power, making NLP part of every developer's toolkit.
<br>
<br>
Cohere’s platform, which is powered by models that have read billions of pages of text and learned to understand the meaning, sentiment and tone of the words we use, enables companies to deploy state-of-the-art NLP capabilities across their businesses without requiring supercomputing infrastructure or AI expertise.
<br>
<br>
With these capabilities, developers and businesses alike can drastically improve applications, uncover new insights, discover cost-saving automation, and effectively understand their customers, at scale.
